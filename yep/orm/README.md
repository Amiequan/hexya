# YEP ORM

This is the home of the YEP ORM.

YEP ORM is an ORM for multi-layer objects based on
[Beego ORM](https://github.com/astaxie/beego/orm).

**Support Database:**

Since YEP ORM is base on Beego ORM, it supports the following databases, by
using the following drivers:

* MySQL: [github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)
* PostgreSQL: [github.com/lib/pq](https://github.com/lib/pq)
* Sqlite3: [github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)

However, only the PostgreSQL driver is guaranteed to be supported by the YEP team
in the future.
